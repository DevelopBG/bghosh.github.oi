## Work Experience
**ResearcH Assistant @ Jadavpur University (2019-2021)**
- Worked on a Government project (RUSA), â€œExpert System Designing for Local Lightning Detection". Developed a smart system for lightnign detection and prediction. 


## Engineer @ Arkaype Project Executors (2014-2017)
- planning engineer for the PGCIL (Gov. India) project which involved the construction of a double-circuit
 230 kV and 400 kV transmission line. Installation of HV transformers at the substation.


**Assistant Engineer @ IVRCL Limited (2012-2014)**
- High Voltage Transmission Line construction. Worked as an on-site as well as a planning engineer of the PGCIL

### Manifold based model security enhancement
[Publication](https://...)

Adversarial attacks on deep learning models present a significant threat, particularly
in high-security applications. In this chapter, we address a few shortcomings in current
defense mechanisms with regards to such attacks and propose a novel solution to learn
robust manifold, which would improve the protection measure of the DNN models.
