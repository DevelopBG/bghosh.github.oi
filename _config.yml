# Build settings
# GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default, but we're using plain HTML
# So we need to exclude Jekyll processing for our HTML files
markdown: kramdown
plugins:
  - jekyll-seo-tag

# Exclude files from processing
exclude:
  - README.md
  - Gemfile
  - Gemfile.lock
  - node_modules
  - vendor

# Include files that start with underscore
include:
  - _config.yml

# Since we're using custom HTML with JavaScript,
# we don't need Jekyll to process our files
# This ensures our HTML files are served as-is
